# GitGetVer
This is small console utility which creates file revision.h and prints there current commit number as C/C++ define.

## Building
I din't put any project files for becase it is really small program. You can do it yourself.

I used VS2013 to build it.

## Running
To run it GitGetVer executable should be inside of repository folder.
The PATH environment variable should contain path to git.exe.

## License
GitGetVer is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 (see LICENSE file).
